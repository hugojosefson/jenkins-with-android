This script contains all the commands and instructions you need to set up a Jenkins server on which you can run Android builds headless, using Maven. You can add Ant yourself if you want that instead.

You can probably run the script as-is. However, some of the comments in it contain relevant information, so you might want to copy/paste one command at the time.

(This script was made available as an add-on to this talk at GTUG Malm√∂ 2011: http://www.slideshare.net/hugojosefson/continuous-integration-with-maven-for-android-apps )
